# Bank Web Service 
https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/info.php?id=13068


The practical assignment for the course is to plan and implement a programmatic book seller web service that hooks into web services provided by eBay and Goodreads. Product information and user ratings for the books are sourced through the REST API of Goodreads, while product offers are fetched from eBay. Payment is handled by "third party‚Äù bank web services, in reality also developed as part of the exercise. Finally, to test the book seller web service, a front-end client is created.

The point of the exercise is to learn how to use and deploy web services. Thus, the actual front-end itself does not need to be anything special. It can be a Javascript enabled web page, or even a text mode program run from the command line. In a similar fashion, the bank service developed don't actually have to do anything sensible (e.g. security checks or balance keeping), but just appear to do so when called from the web.

In the practical assignment, the following high-level functionality is to be implemented:
<ul>
<li>The user can search for books using a keyword search</li>
<li>The search is passed to Goodreads. Additional information about the matched books is also sourced from Goodreads</li> <li>Available offers for the books on the other hand are sourced from eBay</li>
<li>After looking at the books and reviews returned via keyword search, the user selects some books to buy</li>
<li>The books can be paid through two different third party banks, one created by you and another created by another course participant</li>
<li>After a successful payment, the shop acknowledges the order as successful</li>
</ul>

### Development Progress

At the moment, only a REST and a SOAP web services have been implemented. In addition, a testing client has been implemented.

### Technologies

The REST web service was implemented with Python 3.5.0 and [bottle](http://bottlepy.org) while the SOAP with Java7.

### Endpoints

This web service provide (basic) functionalities to verify credit card validity and process a payment. Therefore, the API endpoints are two:
<ul>
<li>check_cc_validity responsible for verifying the validity of a credit card (mock)</li>
<li>process_payment responsible for processing the payment (mock)</li>
</ul>

### Flow
The flow is as follow:
<ol>
<li>The client send a request to the web server (check_cc_validity endpoint), including the credit card details in the body of the message</li>
<li>The web server receives the request, checks the validity of the credit card passed with the request and return a response (either positive, status code 200, or negative, status code 402).</li>
<li>The client receive the response and checks the status code: if it is 402 it returns, otherwise it adds the amount to be payed to the previous payload and it sends a request to the web server (process_payment endpoint).</li>
<li>The web server receives the request and process the payment.</li>
<li>The client receive the response and returns the result of the operation.</li>
</ol>
